I daily drive both Mac and Windows machines, and interact with many Linux systems. As a software engineer, I depend on amazing software from other developers and companies. Depending on what machine I am currently working on, I switch tools / IDEs / software depending on OS I am currently driving.

As negative as the world can be, this is software that I ❤. 

# Software Development

- Jetbrains DataGrip
- Microsoft SQL Management Studio (SSMS)
- SQL
- Postgres
- DBeaver
- Docker


# Utilities / Apps
- AltTab (Mac) 
-- Why does Mac OS think a minimized window is an in-active window and not let you 'switch' to it?
