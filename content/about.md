Hello. I'm Chris Houdeshell. I'm a bit herder, a pointer wrecker, and HTTP is my best friend. 0xA3 & 0x7C are also my friends, but not 0x08. 

I spend my days creating bits that make the cloud fluffy. I love all modern technology but a special place is reserved in my heart for low-level, embedded devices, distributed systems and anything that has a content-type. 

During the day, I conjure up software as the VP of Software Engineering and Operations at [EnergyCAP](http://www.energycap.com). Or I just have meetings about conjuring up software.

I also drink a bit too much coffee â˜• while rambling on about technology. If you are willing to have a conversation -- I am ready to buy you a cup.
